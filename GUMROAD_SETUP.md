## Product Description (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Main Copy

💡 **30 AI Prompts for Freelance Writers Who Want to Ship Faster**

Stop staring at blank pages. Stop rewriting the same paragraph 12 times. Stop Googling "how to write an intro" at 11pm.

This prompt pack gives you ready-to-use prompts that actually work with how you write.

**What's inside:**

✅ **7 Research accelerators** — Get from "I know nothing about this topic" to "I understand the key points" in 10 minutes  
✅ **8 First-draft prompts** — Structure your article, blog post, or client piece without overthinking  
✅ **6 Rewrite & polish helpers** — Keep your voice, remove the fluff, fix the flow  
✅ **5 Client work prompts** — Handle revisions, scope creep, and feedback like a pro  
✅ **4 Idea generators** — Never run out of angles, headlines, or content topics

**Format:** Clean PDF with copy-paste prompts (works with ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI tool)

**Bonus:** Real examples + pro tips for each prompt category

### Who This Is For

✔️ Freelance writers who use AI but want better results  
✔️ Content creators juggling multiple clients  
✔️ Marketers writing blog posts, case studies, or social content  
✔️ Anyone who writes for work and wants to save 5-10 hours a week

### What You'll Get

- **30 proven prompts** organized by workflow stage
- **Quick-start guide** to adapt prompts to your style
- **Real examples** showing before/after outputs
- **Pro tips** to avoid robotic AI-speak
- **Lifetime updates** as we add more prompts

---

### Why This Works

Most prompt packs give you generic, overhyped prompts that sound like they were written by a robot for robots.

This pack is different. Every prompt:
- Starts with your actual writing problems
- Keeps your voice (not ChatGPT's default corporate tone)
- Gives you a draft to edit, not finished copy to post
- Works for real client work, not just "content hacks"

---

### Sample Prompt (Free Preview)

**Research Prompt #3: Find the Counterargument**

"I'm writing about [TOPIC] for [AUDIENCE]. What are the 3 most common objections or criticisms people have about this topic? For each objection, give me:
1. The core concern
2. Why people feel this way
3. A fair, balanced response"

**Why this works:** Good writing addresses doubts. This prompt helps you write with nuance instead of hype.

### FAQ

**Q: Do I need ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro?**  
A: Nope. These prompts work with free versions, though paid plans give better results.

**Q: Can I use these for client work?**  
A: Yes! That's what they're designed for. Edit the AI output to match your client's voice and you're done.

**Q: Will this make me sound like AI wrote it?**  
A: Not if you follow the tips. These prompts are designed to give you drafts to refine, not final copy to post.

**Q: What if I don't like it?**  
A: Email me. If you genuinely tried the prompts and they didn't help, I'll refund you. No BS.

3. **Adjust to your voice** — the prompts are templates, not scripts
