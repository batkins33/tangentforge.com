## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Forms aren't working?**
A: Forms only work on live Netlify sites, not localhost. Deploy first!

**Q: Can I test before deploying?**
A: Yes! Just open index.html in your browser. (Forms won't work locally though)

**Q: How do I make changes?**
A: Edit the files, then:
- Manual deploy: Re-upload to Netlify
- Git deploy: Push to your repo (auto-deploys)

**Q: Don't like the colors?**
A: Edit tokens.css - change `--color-primary` and `--color-secondary`

**Q: Want different fonts?**
A: Change line 30 in index.html + line 20 in tokens.css
